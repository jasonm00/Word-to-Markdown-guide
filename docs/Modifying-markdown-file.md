# How to Convert Word Files to Markdown Using Pandoc

## How to Fix Your New Markdown File

You now have a new Markdown file. Now, it's time for the longest step. Not to worry, though! Because once you're done with this step, you will have done everything you've needed to do.

### Tools

* VS Code

### Steps

1. Recreate your title page and table of contents in Markdown and save it to a file called "index.md"
2. Open your new Markdown file
3. Divide your new Markdown file into sections based on topics.
4. Make each division its own Markdown file

    **NOTE:** Name each file something relevant to the topic. Keep the file name without spaces.
5. Fix all errors in the topic-based Markdown files you just created
6. Edit the table of contents in your index.md so that each item links to one of the new topic-based Markdown files.
7. Include a link back to the main page (index.md) at the bottom of each topic file.

That's all! You have now successfully converted your Word Document into a Markdown file (technically multiple but they should all link to each other).
